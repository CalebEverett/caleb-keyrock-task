## The Challenge

Using (ideally) Rust, or node.js, code a mini project that:

1. connects to two exchanges' websocket feeds at the same time,
1. pulls order books, using these streaming connections, for a given traded pair of currencies (configurable), from each exchange,
1. merges and sorts the order books to create a combined order book,
1. from the combined book, publishes the spread, top ten bids, and top ten asks, as a stream, through a gRPC server.

## Solution

### General Approach

1. Receive a request with symbol and limit properties
1. Validate the symbol to be included is in the intersection of the available symbols from each exchange.
1. Fetch orderbook snapshots from exchanges - deserializing json to a Snapshot struct, which is a vec of bids, a vec of asks and last_updated_id. Bids and asks are [f64; 2]. The exchanges are determined by an ExchangeType enum, currently with just Binance (US) and Bitstamp as variants, but everything is set up to be able to accommodate a variable number of exchanges with just the addition of another variant and associated deserializer.
1. Insert snapshots into Orderbook struct. Orderbook struct consists of price_points which is a vec of PricePoint structs, which are a bids hashmap and an asks hashmap. The hashmaps are <ExchangeType, Amount>, where Amount is a u64. The capacity of the price_point vec is determined by a min_price, a max_price and the number of decimal places to include in the prices. The min_ask and max_bid are updated as bids and asks are inserted.
1. Update orderbook from map of streams for each exchange websocket book diff endpoint.
1. Create Summary message. Iterate through orderbook bids starting with max_bid, decrementing and creating Levels from hashmaps until the number specified by limit have been collected. Iterate through order book asks, incrementing starting with min_ask.
   Send summary message

The orderbook structure was inspired by [rust-orderbook](https://github.com/brettfazio/orderbook).

This solution trades off additional memory usage for the vec of price points for the speed of being able to insert and remove bids and asks in constant time. The space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of price points. The time complexity is O(1) for inserting and removing bids and asks and O(k) for creating the summary where k is a function of the number of levels to include in the summary and the number of price points.

It can manage an aggregate of books with 1000 levels and keep up with providing summaries with 500 levels.

### Running the Solution

A command line interface is provided to run the solution. It takes the following arguments:

```
--symbol
--limit
--min_price
--max_price
--power_price
```

The symbol is the currency pair to be included in the orderbook. The limit is the number of levels to be included in the summary. The min_price and max_price are the minimum and maximum prices to be included in the orderbook and should be set around the current market price. The power_price is the number of decimal places to include in the prices. The order book is managed without decimals - asset amounts are represented as u64 up to 8 decicmal places and prices are represented as u32. The power_price is used to convert the prices to u32 for storage and to convert back to f64 for display.

### Further Enahncements

1. More tests, including one for order book and summary creation from downloaded snapshots.
1. Refactor common.rs code into separate files.
1. Check last updated from websocket diff stream against last updated from snapshots.
1. Documentation.
1. Parallelize creation of summary asks and bids - only need to reference ob - cloning data to summary asks and bids separately
1. Check to see if updating bid and ash hashmaps with zero amount and filtering based on amount not being zero is faster instead of removing zero entries
1. Do a proper analysis of space and time complexity.
1. Benchmarks.
1. Create structs to deseriaize updated into instead of using serde_json::Value.

## Algo Technical Challenge - Q1 2020 - (L2)

### Background

#### Markets

A market is generally a pair of currencies and an exchange where they are traded. For example, ETH (Ethereum) and BTC(Bitcoin) are a pair that together from a traded ‘symbol’, - ETHBTC. This means you can buy or sell ETH using BTC as the ‘pricing’ currency.

#### Order books

Orders at which people are prepared to buy and sell are send to an exchange, such as Binance. The exchange will usually match the buy and sell orders that approach a market ‘mid-price’. The difference between the best ask price and the best bid price is called the spread. The final, merged order book should have the best deals first. That means, if I am selling currency and I want to be the first one to sell, I should be at the best position for this which means am selling the largest amount at the lowest price. Think about this when sorting each side of the order book.

#### gRPC

GRPC (https://grpc.io/) is relatively modern Remote Procedure Call protocol. If you have used anything like GraphQL or Thrift, it should be fairly familiar. If not, it is not difficult to learn! If you are new to RPC you may even find you prefer gRPC’s structured and typed protocol over HTTP Methods.

For this challenge you can use this `protobuf` schema to create your gRPC server:

```proto
syntax = "proto3";

package orderbook;

service OrderbookAggregator {
    rpc BookSummary(Empty) returns (stream Summary);
}

message Empty {}

message Summary {
    double spread = 1;
    repeated Level bids = 2;
    repeated Level asks = 3;
}

message Level {
    string exchange = 1;
    double price = 2;
    double amount = 3;
}
```

#### Relevance

At Keyrock we calculate and stream prices for markets as part of liquidity services and strategies we provide for clients. By gathering order books we can use the top bids and asks to find a fair mid-price. Once we have a mid-price for a market, we can calculate strategies for opening orders in that market. This journey begins with first streaming the current public market order-books internally to our data aggregation and analytics
services. This first step is the background to this challenge.

### Further information

The chosen exchanges for the challenge are Binance and Bitstamp.

#### Binance

Docs for Websocket connection: https://github.com/binance-exchange/binance-official-api-docs/blob/master/web-socket-streams.md

Example API feed: https://api.binance.com/api/v3/depth?symbol=ETHBTC

Websocket connection URL for Binance: wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/ethbtc@depth20@100ms

#### Bitstamp

Docs: https://www.bitstamp.net/websocket/v2/

Example API feed: https://www.bitstamp.net/api/v2/order_book/ethbtc/

Example Websocket usage: https://www.bitstamp.net/s/webapp/examples/order_book_v2.html

(Please note, documentation could change / be updated by the exchanges at any time)

For the configured symbol (e.g. ETH/BTC) the code should fetch the 10 best/lowest asks and the best/highest bids. The output will be a stream of an orderbook created from merging the exchanges' books.

#### Output

The output should be standardised to this type of format (with 10 asks and 10 bids):

```json
{
“spread”: 2.72,
“asks”: [
    { exchange: "binance", price: 8491.25, amount: 0.008 },
    { exchange: "coinbase", price: 8496.37, amount: 0.0303 },
    ...
    ],
“bids”: [
    { exchange: "binance", price: 8488.53, amount: 0.002 },
    { exchange: "kraken", price: 8484.71, amount: 1.0959 },
    ...
    ]
}
```

Here you can see arrays of [ price, amount ] values in JSON representation - but your solution will be streaming from a gRPC server. Values here are made up examples and do not represent what your solution should output.

You should do this from the Web-socket endpoints the exchanges offer (see links below for docs). We want to be able to provide a pair (that will exist in the exchanges) and have your code stream the spread and the top 10 asks and bids for each exchange, on every change of any order book.

This description is intentionally brief so that you have flexibility in how you solve the challenge. You can decide how to present the results, e.g. You may decide to create some kind of CLI wrapper for the tool so it can be used from the command line, or you may decide to make it usable from a URL in some way. This part is not as important as solving the main challenge but feel free to show off - this is your opportunity to show us what you already know - or as a way to express your opinions about how this type of tool/service should be built. Bear in mind that speed is one of the most important factor for us operationally.
